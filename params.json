To run the entire notebook yourself, you need the `radmc3d` executable in your path, or you change `images_done = False` to `True`, in which case the images are not recalculated on the fly, but the pre-calculated images contained in the repository are used.\r\n","google":"UA-60995316-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
